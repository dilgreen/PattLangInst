<p class="paragraph-pl">Towards a Cultural Metaphysics of Complexity</p>

<p class="paragraph-pl"><em>- some seeds -</em></p>
<div class="bodytextctr" id="Introductory remarks">The few patterns you can find here are nothing more than sketches; a partial, single-pass approach from a single author (<a href="http://dilgreen.net"> Dil Green</a> ) - in the hope of communicating the promise of what might be possible if a community became engaged in developing the culture of Pattern Language. This is not to say that such communities do not exist in a number of contexts, around particular scopes. The vision here is one of connection, of interaction, of cross-fertilisation - a context in which all sorts of approaches to Pattern Languages could come into lively relationship.</br> <a href="https://github.com/dilgreen/PattLangInst/blob/main/README.md">To read more about the ambitions behind this site, look here.</a></div>

<p class="paragraph-5-flow">Pattern Language Culture</p>

<div class="bodytext" id="EmergentFlow">We begin with that part of the language that describes a living Pattern Language culture. These patterns cannot be brought directly into existence: all we can do is to gradually create and refine the conditions in which they can develop.</div>

<div class="bodytextbold" id="EmergentPattern"><a href="Transcending_Patterns.html">Transcending Patterns</a></div>

<div class="bodytext-in" id="EmergentPatternFlow">We develop <a href="Pattern_Languages.html"> Pattern Languages</a> , not for their own sake, but because we wish to develop our capacity to live well within complex environments. Pattern languages are a tool which can help us map these environments, trace the flows within them, and develop shared understanding of these in community. But the languages are not where we want to live - if the languages are useful, it is as a learning and a practice that connects our unconsciousness - the most capable and flexible tool for engaging with complexity known to us - with our reality.</div>

<div class="bodytextbold" id="EmergentPattern"><a href="Melted_Unity.html">Melted Unity</a></div>

<div class="bodytext-in" id="EmergentPatternFlow">The domains that are appropriate for building <a href="Pattern_Languages.html"> Pattern Languages</a> around are complex systems, full of feeedback loops and interconnections.When the forces at work in these systems are well resolved at each interaction locus, the system will approach the condition of a Melted Unity - where each aspect seems utterly implicated by the whole, and vice versa. Pattern Languages cannot in themselvs build such conditions - any more than dictionaries in themselves can build stories. Practice and develop skill with the <a href="Poetry_of_the_Language.html"> Poetry of the Language</a> with the aim of <a href="Transcending_Patterns.html"> Transcending Patterns</a> To foster Melted Unities.</div>

<div class="bodytext-in" id="EmergentPatternFlow">Seeking to be <a href="Transcending_Patterns.html"> Transcending Patterns</a> , wanting to support the emergnce of the condition of <a href="Melted_Unity.html"> Melted Unity</a> , we hope to contribute to the development of the social capacity to use the Language as Poetry.</div>

<div class="bodytext" id="EmergentFlow">To achieve a cultural condition which understands that complexity is the most salient characteristic of life-like conditions, and which can engage assuredly with complexity in the furtherance of life, we need scaffolding. We need to build the frameworks within which intelligence, creativity, curiosity and love can develop such a culture.</div>

<div class="bodytextbold" id="EmergentPattern"><a href="Pattern_Languages.html">Pattern Languages</a></div>

<div class="bodytext-in" id="EmergentPatternFlow">Desirous of interacting beneficially with the <a href="Melted_Unity.html"> Melted Unity</a> that is reality, we build Pattern Languages. Through familiarity and practice with these, we hope to become capable with the <a href="Poetry_of_the_Language.html"> Poetry of the Language</a> , and in the end, become capable of <a href="Transcending_Patterns.html"> Transcending Patterns.</a></div>

<div class="bodytext" id="EmergentFlow">In order for Pattern Languages to be viable, they must live - be seeded, grow, develop, respond, interact, and eventually lose vitality and melt into the background culture.</div>

<div class="bodytext-in" id="EmergentPatternFlow">As we develop <a href="Pattern_Languages.html"> Pattern Languages</a> and the skills of the <a href="Poetry_of_the_Language.html"> Poetry of the Language</a> , we need to pay attention to the processes which will keep it relevant.</div>

<div class="bodytextbold" id="EmergentPattern"><a href="Social_Poetry.html">Social Poetry</a></div>

<div class="bodytext-in" id="EmergentPatternFlow">We are building a <a href="Living_Language.html"> Living Language</a> , understanding that it must support the <a href="Poetry_of_the_Language.html"> Poetry of the Language</a> ; but this poetry cannot be &#39;written&#39; by individuals.</div>

<div class="bodytextbold" id="EmergentPattern"><a href="Life_cycle_of_a_Language.html">Life cycle of a Language</a></div>

<div class="bodytext-in" id="EmergentPatternFlow">Now that we have an understanding that all <a href="Pattern_Languages.html"> Pattern Languages</a> must have the character of <a href="Living_Language.html"> Living Language</a> , we must understand that they will come into being, strive to grow and develop, gain strength and capacity, and at last be prepared to die. We need to understand that they have a life cycle...</div>

<div class="bodytext-in" id="EmergentPatternFlow">We are working to develop a <a href="Living_Language.html"> Living Language</a> , fostering the <a href="Social_Poetry.html"> Social Poetry</a> . Now we can begin to think about the specific social structures through which this becomes real.</div>
